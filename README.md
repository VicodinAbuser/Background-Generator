Love adding cool looking gradients to your websites? Ofcourse, you do!
All you need to do that is visit this site, select two colors from the two color-pickers and you'll have the CSS code required to render that gradient which you can now copy-paste into your application! And just so you know what result you'll be getting, as you'll slide across the color-picker to select the color of your choice, the background of the page will change accordingly so you get to see exactly what gradient you'll be getting if you paste the code into your application.
